# Image classification

## Overview

This project provides two modes to work with. The first mode requires a local installation of Miniconda/Conda with Python 3.10 and TensorFlow 2.11, and is used to run Python scripts that generate datasets, preprocess them, and train machine learning models headlessly. The second mode requires Docker to be installed, and provides a playground environment using Jupyter Notebooks, where you can analyze datasets and experiment with the code in a more interactive fashion.

## Installation

### 1. Miniconda/Conda Mode

To use this mode, you need to have Miniconda/Conda installed on your system with Python 3.10 and TensorFlow 2.11. You can download and install Miniconda from the official website: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.

Once you have installed Miniconda/Conda, you need to create a new environment for this project and activate it. Than install tensorflow using pip or from source (recommended for max performance).

### 2. Jupyter-notebook Mode

To use this mode, you need to have Docker installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from the official website: https://www.docker.com/get-started.

## Usage

### 1. Miniconda/Conda Mode

```
.
├── dataset_preparation
│   └── generate_time_series_dataset.py
└── neural_networks
    ├── classification_frame.py
    └── classification_time_series.py

```

for example:
python dataset_preparation/generate_time_series_dataset.py

### 2. Jupyter-notebook Mode

To start jupyter run start-jupyter.sh file, this script will use docker to pull and run tensorflow-jupyter-gpu image from docker hub and it will also mount volumes from host system so container has access to /data and /models. This mechanism will let user keep all data generated by container after its destruction.

```
sh start-jupyter.sh
```

expected output looks like this.

```
